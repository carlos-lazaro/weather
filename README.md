## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Make sure your development environment uses an Gradle JDK compatible with **Java 21**.
2. Create a `local.properties` file in the project root (next to `settings.gradle` and `build.gradle`) if it doesn't exist.  
   You can refer to the example file: [`local.properties.example`](local.properties.example)
3. Add the following keys, replacing the placeholder values with your own credentials:

```properties
apiKey=<your API key from https://openweathermap.org/>
baseUrl=https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/
googleMapApiKey=<your API key to use Google Maps>
```
